# Shoe Personality Quiz App

Welcome to the Shoe Personality Quiz App! This unique application combines the fun of a Buzzfeed-style quiz with the cutting-edge capabilities of AI to generate a pair of shoes that fits your personality. Powered by Gradio, GPT-4, and DALL-E, this app offers a one-of-a-kind experience that's both engaging and technologically fascinating.

## Features

- A 4-question quiz designed to gauge your personality and preferences.
- A summary of your personality based on your quiz responses.
- A photorealistic image of shoes generated by DALL-E, inspired by your personality summary.
- A user-friendly interface to interact with the quiz and view your personalized shoes.
- The ability to retake the quiz and generate new results.

## How It Works

1. **Take the Quiz**: Start by answering four simple questions about your preferences and personality.
2. **View Your Summary**: Based on your answers, the app will generate a summary of your personality.
3. **See Your Shoes**: The app then feeds this summary into DALL-E, which generates a unique, photorealistic image of shoes that match your personality.
4. **Retake if Desired**: Not satisfied with your results? You can easily start over and try again for different outcomes.
